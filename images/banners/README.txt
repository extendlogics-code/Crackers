Put your real banner photos here to override the default SVG designs.

How it works
- The home slider checks, in order: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp, .svg
- Filenames to use:
  - slide1.jpg (e.g., flowerpots / fountains)
  - slide2.jpg (e.g., bombs / sound crackers)
  - slide3.jpg (e.g., rockets / aerials)

Tips
- Recommended size: 1600x600 (or any 16:6-ish wide banner)
- Keep key content toward the center for mobile cropping
- Files are loaded locally; no external URLs required

If a file is missing, the code falls back to the corresponding SVG.
